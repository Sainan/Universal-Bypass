# Privacy Policy

When Crowd Bypass (Options > "Give and take the destinations of unbypassable shorteners.") is enabled, a request to my server is being sent for it to work.
These requests are stored in correlation with your IP address for up to 6 months in Germany and shared with the US-based company Cloudflare, who store it for up to 3 hours.
Your requests could reveal part of your browsing history â€” e.g., when Universal Bypass sends a request asking "Has anyone already waited on bc.vc/urg?", Cloudflare and I know that someone at your IP has just visited bc.vc/urg.
However, I only use this to provide the Crowd Bypass service, and Cloudflare uses it to secure many websites, including mine.
